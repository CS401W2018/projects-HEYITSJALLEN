        <p>
            Science fiction movies have always been a favorite of mine. I love how they allow filmmakers to explore futuristic worlds, advanced technologies, and philosophical questions about humanity. Whether it's space exploration, artificial intelligence, or time travel, sci-fi films push the boundaries of imagination.

            What draws me to these movies is the way they combine storytelling with speculative science. Watching a good sci-fi movie not only entertains me but also makes me think about the future of our world, the possibilities of new technologies, and the ethical dilemmas that may arise with advancements in science.

            A relative link is a link that points to a page within the same website or project directory. Here's a relative link to my <a href="profile.html">Profile Page</a> from my first assignment. An absolute link, on the other hand, points to an external website or a full URL. Here's an absolute link to a website about science fiction movies: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/list/ls053181649/" target="_blank">IMDB Sci-Fi List</a>.
