        <p>
            One of my biggest interest is Judo. I started to learn and play judo in highschool. 
            The sport was more than just physical competition; it was a mental challenge, a test of discipline, and a way to connect with a community of like-minded individuals. 
            Each practice was a chance to refine my technique, build strength, and learn valuable lessons about perseverance and respect.
            Judo taught me the importance of balance, control, and the power of a focused mind. It's a sport that has had a lasting impact on my life, and I cherish the memories I made on the mat.
