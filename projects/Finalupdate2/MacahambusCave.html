        <br><p>Macahambus Cave, located in Cagayan de Oro City, is a historical and natural landmark with significant cultural and ecological importance. This short cave, which opens to a lush gorge, was a key site during the Battle of Macahambus Hill in 1900, where Filipino forces triumphed against American troops in the Philippine-American War. Today, the cave offers visitors a glimpse of its rich history while being a haven for nature lovers, with its unique limestone formations, nearby forest, and picturesque view of the Cagayan River. A visit to Macahambus Cave is both an educational and scenic experience, combining history, adventure, and natural beauty.</p><br>
